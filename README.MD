# An Easy WINE Apps Installer
WIP

Utilizes the system WINE install, [WINE AppImage Launcher](https://github.com/mmtrt/WINE_AppImage), or [umu-launcher](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher) to install a windows application under its own prefix, with working protocol handling support.  

This is intended to make it easier to get a new application running by putting together a config.

# Why this?
You could use bottles, or lutris, or something similar if you wanted. For a lot of people there is a desire for an easy way to install a mod manager, and a lot of the implementation make it a real pain to get things like one-click installers working. This is just another option to try to make it feel a bit better integrated to your operating system.
